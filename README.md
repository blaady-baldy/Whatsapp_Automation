INTRODUCTION
------------

Whatsapp Automation basically provides you with 
  1. Messages (Personalized/Standard)
  2. Media files(image/video)
  3. Pdf
to send to multiple contacts.

The idea for the project was to provide easy ways for people starting their businesses
and storing data in excel to reach out to their customers in an easy way.
Most people start registration for events/webinars/startups with the help of Google 
forms which convert the data into excel sheets.
This project helps user to generate personalised messages and reach out to their
audience in an easy and efficient way avoiding errors and saving time and space.
